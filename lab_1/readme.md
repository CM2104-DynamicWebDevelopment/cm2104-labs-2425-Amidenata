# Lab 1
This is a markdown file, generally the readme.md file in a repository tells any users what it is for. You should use this file every week to describe, briefly, what you have done.

Setting up my codio and github account. Opened Visual studio code, copied my clone address from github then paste it in visual studio clone. Saved the repository to my onedrive folder. All files that were on my github have been copied to VS code. Created a new file called index.html in lab_1 folder. Wrote down the code given in the into the index.html file. Tried to pull and push, when trying to commit it. It wasn't working so had to open Terminal in VS code and entered commands, then it worked. However, had to log into github when tryied to commit again. Logged in then it workrd the file has been added to my repository. Opened codio and used Terminal, had to clone my repository. Then I went into my directory, typed ls to copy all my files from repository onto my server. Tried to run my server, typed node SimpleServer.js, enter, then opened browser, to see my code running on a real server.
